Every morning the janitor maintains the cleanliness, and the maintenance crew checks the vents, air filters, sewage, and electrical connections. All these to ensure that the workspace is clean. Just the same, at home, make it a habit to clean consistently. Have a monthly check on your water pipes, heating, air conditioning as well as electrical connections. You&rsquo;ll be less anxious and be more at ease.</p>
